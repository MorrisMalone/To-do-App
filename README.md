This app allows you to create new projects with tasks you need to perform.

You can update your projects, delete tasks or add new ones to existing projects, etc...

It uses local storage to store your projects so if you want to use it for real, you'll need to never delete your browser history...
which is obviously compensated by the amazingness of this app.

It's hopefully intuitive enough so you don't need any documentation (since I didn't do any!).

I hope it is visually pleasant too!
